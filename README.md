Simple crappy scanner to check in with Corona-Warn-App vCard

Plug in a QR-Code Scanner via USB, that functions as a USB Keyboard (in the Verschw√∂rhaus: Datalogic Magellan 1500i) and a Receipt Printer. Than execute the scanloop.sh. You can scan the vCard in the Corona-Warn-App or press the Enter Button to get an empty piece.
If you want to see, how many people were checked-in, type in 'stats' and press Enter.

Future Features: Scan and validate the vaccination certificate.
